# Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript #   
* Object in the javascript is the datatype which contain any combination of  primitive data-types and reference data-types.   
* objects are  different from  primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) is that these primitive data-types all store a single value of each.   
* Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference to that value.   
* Every object has in the form of "key: value" pairs.   
* The object can be created in the form of  curly braces.   
* The key and the value will be stored inside the curly braces.   
* For example:   
  let car= {name:'bmw', model:'sclass', showroom:'chennai'}
